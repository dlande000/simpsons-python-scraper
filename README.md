# simpsons-python-scraper

The Simpsons Python Scraper scrapes the data for all 30 seasons of the Simpsons from IMDB and writes the data into a CSV file. Currently, the scraper writes the season number, the episode number, the episode title, the original airdate, the episode description, and a link to an image from the episode. 

Written in Python, simpsons-python-scraper utilizes urllib2 and BeautifulSoup. All Simpsons data comes from IMDB. 

Although I originally wrote simpsons-python-scraper as one component for a larger project, I decided to share the scraper as is while I continue working on the other project.
